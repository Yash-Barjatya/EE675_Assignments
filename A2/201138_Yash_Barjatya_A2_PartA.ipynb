    "- Both algorithms, Policy Iteration (PI) and Value Iteration (VI), are guaranteed to converge to an optimal policy in the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The optimal policy given by both methods is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In terms of convergence, Policy Iteration (PI) involves two main steps: policy evaluation and policy improvement. It iterates between these steps until the policy converges. However, it tends to converge relatively slowly as it alternates between evaluating and improving the policy in each iteration. Policy Iteration requires multiple iterations to converge, and in our case, it took 4 policy improvement loops, with an average of 100.75 policy evaluation iterations in each loop, resulting in a total of 100.75×4=403 iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- On the other hand, Value Iteration (VI) directly iterates over the value function and updates it until it converges to the optimal value function. It typically converges faster than PI because it doesn't alternate between policy evaluation and improvement. VI converges after a smaller number of iterations compared to PI. In our case, it took 102 iterations for Value Iteration to converge.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In summary, while both algorithms eventually converge to the optimal policy, Value Iteration tends to converge faster due to its direct iteration over the value function, whereas Policy Iteration alternates between policy evaluation and improvement, resulting in a slower convergence rate."
